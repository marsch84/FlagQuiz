Flag Quiz
---------
This game is a small flag guessing quiz using the Qt library. It includes two game modes, which are called national flag quiz and country name quiz. In the national flag quiz a name of a county is given and the player has to choose the country's national flag out of four possible answers. In the second quiz mode the country name corresponding to a presented flag has to be guessed. Each round of the game is 60 seconds long. Right answers add points to the players score, whereas wrong answers result in penalty points.
